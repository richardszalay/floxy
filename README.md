Runtime dynamic proxy generation library for Flash/Flex

FLoxy is a dynamic proxy generation library for Flash/Flex. The library itself has been part of the ASMock dynamic mocking framework since its inception, but increasing usage of the dynamic proxy code has pushed me to create a separate project.

This project supports the public APIs for the proxy generation code only; for the dynamic byte code generation code that FLoxy is based on, see the [FLemit](https://github.com/richardszalay/flemit) project.
